# Tailwind CSS Styling Not Applied Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: unexpected styling problems due to a lack of proper configuration or directives. 

The `bug.js` file shows a simple code snippet that uses Tailwind CSS classes. However, without the correct setup in your project's CSS file, these classes will not render the intended styles. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to correct this using the proper directives to include the styles from your Tailwind configuration file.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Try to render the `bug.js` file in a web browser without including the necessary Tailwind CSS directives. You should see that the styling is missing or incorrect. 
3. Include the Tailwind directives from the `bugSolution.js` file into your CSS and observe the correct styling.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring you've correctly configured and included Tailwind CSS in your project, often through the use of `@tailwind directives`. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the required Tailwind directives, although the specific implementation may vary based on your setup (e.g., using PostCSS, webpack loaders, etc.).
