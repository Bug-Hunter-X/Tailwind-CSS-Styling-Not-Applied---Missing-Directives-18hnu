```javascript
/*
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
*/

<div class="bg-gray-300 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This solution includes the necessary `@tailwind` directives at the beginning of the CSS file to ensure Tailwind CSS compiles and applies styles correctly. Remember to adapt these directives depending on your specific Tailwind setup and build process.
